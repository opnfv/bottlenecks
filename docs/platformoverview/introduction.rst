Bottlenecks Introduction
**************************

**Welcome to bottlenecks' documentation !**

Bottlenecks_ is an OPNFV Project.

The project's goal is to find system bottlenecks by testing and verifying
OPNFV infrastructure in a staging environment before committing it to a production environment.
Instead of debugging a deployment in production environment,
an automatic method for executing benchmarks which plans to
validate the deployment during staging is adopted.
This project will provide frameworks to find the bottlenecks of OPNFV infrastructure.
