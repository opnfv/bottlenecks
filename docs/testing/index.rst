Bottlenecks_ is an OPNFV testing Project.

The project's goal is to find system bottlenecks by testing and verifying
OPNFV infrastructure in a staging environment before committing it to a production environment.
Instead of debugging a deployment in production environment,
an automatic method for executing benchmarks which plans to
validate the deployment during staging is adopted.
This project forms a staging framework to find bottlenecks and to do analysis of the OPNFV infrastructure.

The *Bottlenecks* framework is deployed in several  OPNFV community labs. It is
installer, infrastructure and application independent.
