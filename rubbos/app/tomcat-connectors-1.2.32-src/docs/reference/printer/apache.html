<p>
Most of the directives are allowed once in the global part of the Apache httpd
configuration and once in every &lt;VirtualHost&gt; elements. Exceptions from this rule are
explicitly listed in the table below.
</p>
<p>
Most values are inherited from the main server to the virtual hosts.
Since version 1.2.20 they can be overwritten in the virtual hosts.
Exceptions from this rule are again explicitly listed in the table below.
See especially JkMountCopy.

<p><font color="#ff0000">
Warning: If Apache httpd and Tomcat are configured to serve content from
the same filing system location then care must be taken to ensure that httpd is
not able to serve inappropriate content such as the contents of the WEB-INF
directory or JSP source code.
</font></p>
<p>
This could occur if the httpd DocumentRoot
overlaps with a Tomcat Host's appBase or the docBase of any Context. It could
also occur when using the httpd Alias directive with a Tomcat Host's appBase or
the docBase of any Context.
</p>
<p>
Here are the all directives supported by Apache:
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5"><tr><th width="20%" bgcolor="#023264"><font color="#ffffff">Directive</font></th><th width="80%" bgcolor="#023264"><font color="#ffffff">Description</font></th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="center"><code>JkWorkersFile</code></td><td align="left" valign="center"><p>
The name of a worker file for the Tomcat servlet containers.
<br>
This directive is only allowed once. It must be put into
the global part of the configuration.
<br>
If you don't use the JkWorkerProperty directives, then you must
define your workers with a valid JkWorkersFile. There is no default
value.
</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="center"><code>JkWorkerProperty</code></td><td align="left" valign="center"><p>
Enables setting worker properties inside Apache configuration file.
The syntax is the same as in the JkWorkersFile (usually workers.properties).
Simply prefix each line with "JkWorkerProperty" to put it directly into
the Apache httpd config files.
<br>
This directive is allowed multiple times.
It must be put into the global part of the configuration.
<br>
If you don't use the JkWorkerProperty directives, then you must
define your workers with a valid JkWorkersFile. There is no default
value.
<br>
This directive is available in jk1.2.7 version and later.
</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="center"><code>JkShmFile</code></td><td align="left" valign="center"><p>
Shared memory file name. Used only on unix platforms.
The shm file is used by balancer and status workers.
<br>
This directive is only allowed once. It must be put into
the global part of the configuration.
<br>
The default value is logs/jk-runtime-status.
It is highly recommended that the shm file be placed on a local
drive and not an NFS share.
</p>
<p>
The shared memory contains configuration and runtime information for load balancer
workers and their members. It is need in order that all apache children
<ul>
<li>share the same status information for load balancing members (OK, ERROR, ...),</li>
<li>share the information about load taken by the individual workers,</li>
<li>share the information for the parts of the configuration, which are changeable
during runtime by status workers.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="center"><code>JkShmSize</code></td><td align="left" valign="center"><p>
Size of the shared memory file name.
<br>
This directive is only allowed once. It must be put into
the global part of the configuration.
<br>
The default value depends on the platform. It is usually less than 64KB.
</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="center"><code>JkMountFile</code></td><td align="left" valign="center"><p>
File containing multiple mappings from a context to a Tomcat worker.
It is usually called uriworkermap.properties.
<br>
For inheritance rules, see: JkMountCopy.
<br>
There is no default value.
</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="center"><code>JkMountFileReload</code></td><td align="left" valign="center"><p>
This directive configures the reload check interval in seconds.
The JkMountFile is checked periodically for changes.
A changed file gets reloaded automatically. If you set
this directive to "0", reload checking is turned off.
<br>
The default value is 60 seconds.
<br>
This directive has been added in version 1.2.20 of mod_jk.
</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="center"><code>JkMount</code></td><td align="left" valign="center"><p>
A mount point from a context to a Tomcat worker.
<br>
This directive is allowed multiple times.
It is allowed in the global configuration and in VirtualHost.
You can also use it inside Location with a different syntax.
Inside Location, one omits the first argument (path),
which gets inherited from the Location.
<br>
By default JkMount entries are not inherited from the global
server to other VirtualHosts or between VirtualHosts.
For the complete inheritance rules, see: JkMountCopy.
</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="center"><code>JkUnMount</code></td><td align="left" valign="center"><p>
An exclusion mount point from a context to a Tomcat worker.
All exclusion mounts are checked after mapping a request
to a tomcat worker. If the request maps also to an exclusion,
it will not be forwarded to tomcat, and instead be served locally.
<br>
This directive is allowed multiple times.
It is allowed in the global configuration and in VirtualHost.
You can also use it inside Location with a different syntax.
Inside Location, one omits the first argument (path),
which gets inherited from the Location.
For inheritance rules, see: JkMountCopy.
<br>
This directive is available in jk1.2.7 version and later.
</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="center"><code>JkAutoAlias</code></td><td align="left" valign="center"><p>
Automatically Alias webapp context directories into the Apache
document space.
<br>
Care should be taken to ensure that only static content is served via httpd as a
result of using this directive. Any static content served by httpd will bypass any
security constraints defined in the application's web.xml.
<br>
For inheritance rules, see: JkMountCopy.
<br>
There is no default value.
</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="center"><code>JkMountCopy</code></td><td align="left" valign="center"><p>
If this directive is set to "On" in some virtual server,
the mounts from the global server will be copied to this
virtual server, more precisely all mounts defined by JkMount
or JkUnMount. The Mounts defined by JkMountFile and JkAutoAlias
will only be inherited, if the VirtualHost does not define
it's own JkMountFile or JkAutoAlias.
<br>
If you want all vhost to inherit mounts from the main server,
you can set JkMountCopy to 'All' in the main server.
<br>
This directive is only allowed inside VirtualHost (with value "On")
and in the global server (with value "All").
<br>
The default is Off, so no mounts will be inherited from the global
server to any VirtualHost.
<br>
Starting with version 1.2.26 you can also set it to "All" in the
global virtual server. This will switch the default to On.
</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="center"><code>JkWorkerIndicator</code></td><td align="left" valign="center"><p>
Name of the Apache environment variable that can be used to set worker names
in combination with SetHandler jakarta-servlet.
<br>
This directive is only allowed once per virtual server.
It is allowed in the global configuration and in VirtualHost.
<br>
The default value is JK_WORKER_NAME.
</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="center"><code>JkWatchdogInterval</code></td><td align="left" valign="center"><p>
This directive configures the watchdog thread interval in seconds.
The workers are maintained periodically by a background thread
running periodically every watchdog_interval seconds. Worker maintenance
checks for idle connections, corrects load status and is able
to detect backend health status.
<br>
The maintenance only happens, if since the last maintenance at
least <a href="workers.html"><b class="code">worker.maintain</b></a>
seconds have passed. So setting the JkWatchdogInterval
much smaller than <b class="code">worker.maintain</b> is not useful.
<br>
The default value is 0 seconds, meaning the watchdog thread
will not be created, and the maintenance is done in combination
with normal requests instead.
<br>
This directive is only allowed once. It must be put into
the global part of the configuration.
<br>
This directive has been added in version 1.2.27 of mod_jk.
It is available only for httpd 2.x and above using APR libraries
including thread support.
</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="center"><code>JkLogFile</code></td><td align="left" valign="center"><p>
Full or server relative path to the Tomcat Connector module log file.
It will also work with pipe, by using a value of the form "| ...".
<br>
The default value is logs/mod_jk.log.
<br>
Pipes are supported for Apache 1.3 only since version 1.2.16.
The default value exists only since version 1.2.20.
</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="center"><code>JkLogLevel</code></td><td align="left" valign="center"><p>
The Tomcat Connector module log level, can be debug, info, warn
error or trace.
<br>
The default value is info.
</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="center"><code>JkLogStampFormat</code></td><td align="left" valign="center"><p>
The Tomcat Connector module <b>date</b> log format, using an
extended strftime syntax.
This format will be used for the time stamps in the JkLogFile.
The maximum length of the format is 63 characters.
<br>
Starting with version 1.2.24 of mod_jk you can also use %Q
for adding milliseconds to the log and %q for microseconds. 
These conversion specifiers are an extension to strftime.
They will only work on platforms with a gettimeofday() function.
You can use %Q and %q only once in the pattern and also not both
together in the same pattern.
<br>
The default value is "[%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y] " and beginning
with version 1.2.24 on platforms with a gettimeofday()
function it is "[%a %b %d %H:%M:%S.%Q %Y] ".
</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="center"><code>JkRequestLogFormat</code></td><td align="left" valign="center"><p>
Request log format string. See detailed description below.
<br>
There is no default value. Without defining a value, the request logging
is turned off.
</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="center"><code>JkExtractSSL</code></td><td align="left" valign="center"><p>
Turns on SSL processing and information gathering by mod_jk
<br>
The default value is On.
<br>
In order to make SSL data available for mod_jk in Apache, you need to
set <b class="code">SSLOptions +StdEnvVars</b>. For the certificate information you also need
to add <b class="code">SSLOptions +ExportCertData</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Specifically, mod_jk will export the following environment variables from
  Apache httpd to Tomcat under these request attributes as per the
  Servlet Specification 3.0, section 3.8:

<p>
The directive JkOptions allow you to set many forwarding options which will enable (+)
or disable (-) following option. Without any leading signs, options will be enabled.
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
The four following options <b>+ForwardURIxxx</b> are mutually exclusive.
Exactly one of them is required, a negative sign prefix is not allowed with them.
The default value is "ForwardURIProxy" since version 1.2.24.
It was "ForwardURICompatUnparsed" in version 1.2.23 and
"ForwardURICompat" until version 1.2.22.
You can turn the default off by switching on one of the other two options.
You should leave this at it's default value, unless you have a very good
reason to change it.
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
All options are inherited from the global server to virtual hosts.
Options that support enabling (plus options) and disabling (minus options),
are inherited in the following way:
<br>
<br>
options(vhost) = plus_options(global) - minus_options(global) + plus_options(vhost) - minus_options(vhost)
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
Using JkOptions <b>ForwardURIProxy</b>, the forwarded URI
will be partially reencoded after processing inside Apache httpd and
before forwarding to Tomcat. This will be compatible with local
URL manipulation by mod_rewrite and with URL encoded session ids.

<div class="example"><pre>
  JkOptions     +ForwardURIProxy
</pre></div>

<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
Using JkOptions <b>ForwardURICompatUnparsed</b>, the forwarded URI
will be unparsed. It's spec compliant and secure.
It will always forward the original request URI, so rewriting
URIs with mod_rewrite and then forwarding the rewritten URI
will not work.

<div class="example"><pre>
  JkOptions     +ForwardURICompatUnparsed
</pre></div>

<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
Using JkOptions <b>ForwardURICompat</b>, the forwarded URI will
be decoded by Apache httpd. Encoded characters will be decoded and
explicit path components like ".." will already be resolved.
This is less spec compliant and is <b>not safe</b> if you are using
prefix JkMount. This option will allow to rewrite URIs with
mod_rewrite before forwarding.

<div class="example"><pre>
  JkOptions     +ForwardURICompat
</pre></div>

<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
Using JkOptions <b>ForwardURIEscaped</b>, the forwarded URI will
be the encoded form of the URI used by ForwardURICompat.
Explicit path components like ".." will already be resolved.
This will not work in combination with URL encoded session IDs,
but it will allow to rewrite URIs with mod_rewrite before forwarding.

<div class="example"><pre>
  JkOptions     +ForwardURIEscaped
</pre></div>

<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
JkOptions <b>RejectUnsafeURI</b> will block all
URLs, which contain percent signs '%' or backslashes '\'
after decoding.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
Most web apps do not use such URLs. Using the option RejectUnsafeURI, you
can block several well known URL encoding attacks. By default, this option
is not set.
</p>
<p>
You can also realise such a check with mod_rewrite, which is more powerful
but also slightly more complicated.

<div class="example"><pre>  
  JkOptions     +RejectUnsafeURI
</pre></div>

<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
JkOptions <b>ForwardDirectories</b> is used in conjunction with <b>DirectoryIndex</b>
directive of Apache web server. As such mod_dir should be available to Apache,
statically or dynamically (DSO)
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
When DirectoryIndex is configured, Apache will create sub-requests for
each of the local-url's specified in the directive, to determine if there is a
local file that matches (this is done by stat-ing the file).
</p>

<p>
If ForwardDirectories is set to false (default) and Apache doesn't find any
files that match, Apache will serve the content of the directory (if directive
Options specifies Indexes for that directory) or a <b class="code">403 Forbidden</b> response (if
directive Options doesn't specify Indexes for that directory).
</p>

<p>
If ForwardDirectories is set to true and Apache doesn't find any files that
match, the request will be forwarded to Tomcat for resolution. This is used in
cases when Apache cannot see the index files on the file system for various
reasons: Tomcat is running on a different machine, the JSP file has been
precompiled etc. 
</p>

<p>Note that locally visible files will take precedence over the
ones visible only to Tomcat (i.e. if Apache can see the file, that's the one
that's going to get served). This is important if there is more then one type of
file that Tomcat normally serves - for instance Velocity pages and JSP pages.

<div class="example"><pre>  
  JkOptions     +ForwardDirectories
</pre></div>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
JkOptions <b>ForwardLocalAddress</b>, you ask mod_jk to send the local address,
of the Apache web server instead remote client address. This can be used by
Tomcat remote address valve for allowing connections only from registered Apache
web servers.

<div class="example"><pre>  
  JkOptions     +ForwardLocalAddress
</pre></div>

<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
JkOptions <b>FlushPackets</b>, you ask mod_jk to flush Apache's connection
buffer after each AJP packet chunk received from Tomcat. This option can have
a strong performance penalty for Apache and Tomcat as writes are performed
more often than would normally be required (ie: at the end of each
response).

<div class="example"><pre>  
  JkOptions     +FlushPackets
</pre></div>

<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
JkOptions <b>FlushHeader</b>, you ask mod_jk to flush Apache's connection
buffer after the response headers have been  received from Tomcat.

<div class="example"><pre>  
  JkOptions     +FlushHeader
</pre></div>

<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
JkOptions <b>DisableReuse</b>, you ask mod_jk to close connections immediately
after their use. Normally mod_jk uses persistent connections and pools idle
connections to reuse them, when new requests have to be sent to Tomcat.
</p>

<p>
Using this option will have a strong performance penalty for Apache and Tomcat.
Use this only as a last resort in case of unfixable network problems.
If a firewall between Apache and Tomcat silently kills idle connections,
try to use the worker attribute socket_keepalive in combination with an appropriate
TCP keepalive value in your OS.

<div class="example"><pre>  
  JkOptions     +DisableReuse
</pre></div>

<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
JkOptions <b>ForwardKeySize</b>,  you ask mod_jk, when using ajp13, to forward also the SSL Key Size  as 
required by Servlet API 2.3.
This flag shouldn't be set when servlet engine is Tomcat 3.2.x (on by default).

<div class="example"><pre>  
  JkOptions     +ForwardKeySize
</pre></div>

<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
JkOptions <b>ForwardSSLCertChain</b>,  you ask mod_jk, when using ajp13,
to forward SSL certificate chain (off by default).
Mod_jk only passes the <b class="code">SSL_CLIENT_CERT</b> to the AJP connector. This is not a
problem with self-signed certificates or certificates directly signed by the
root CA certificate. However, there's a large number of certificates signed by
an intermediate CA certificate, where this is a significant problem: A servlet
will not have the possibility to validate the client certificate on its own. The
bug would be fixed by passing on the <b class="code">SSL_CLIENT_CERT_CHAIN</b> to Tomcat via the AJP connector.
<br>
This directive exists only since version 1.2.22.
<div class="example"><pre>  
  JkOptions     +ForwardSSLCertChain
</pre></div>

<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
The directive <b>JkEnvVar</b> allows you to forward environment variables
from Apache server to Tomcat engine.
You can add a default value as a second parameter to the directive.
If the default value is not given explicitly, the variable
will only be send, if it is set during runtime.
<br>
The variables can be retrieved on the Tomcat side as request attributes
via request.getAttribute(attributeName).
Note that the variables send via JkEnvVar will not be listed
in request.getAttributeNames().
<br>
<br>
The variables are inherited from the global server to virtual hosts.

<div class="example"><pre>  
  JkEnvVar     SSL_CLIENT_V_START     undefined
</pre></div>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
If you have created a custom or local version of mod_jk.conf-local as noted above, 
you can change settings such as the workers or URL prefix.
</p>
<p>
<b>JkMount</b> directive assign specific URLs to Tomcat. 
In general the structure of a JkMount directive is:
</p>

<div class="example"><pre>  
  JkMount [URL prefix] [Worker name]
</pre></div>

<div class="example"><pre>
  # send all requests ending in .jsp to worker1
  JkMount /*.jsp worker1
  # send all requests ending /servlet to worker1
  JkMount /*/servlet/ worker1
  # send all requests jsp requests to files located in /otherworker will go worker2
  JkMount /otherworker/*.jsp worker2
</pre></div>

<p>
You can use the JkMount directive at the top level or inside &lt;VirtualHost&gt;
sections of your httpd.conf file.
</p>
<p><b>JkUnMount</b> directive acts as an opposite to JkMount and blocks access
to a particular URL. The purpose is to be able to filter out the particular content
types from mounted context. The following example mounts /servlet/*
context, but all .gif files that belongs to that context are not served.
</p>
<div class="example"><pre>
  # send all requests ending with /servlet to worker1
  JkMount /servlet/* worker1
  # do not send requests ending with .gif to worker1
  JkUnMount /servlet/*.gif worker1
</pre></div>
<p>
JkUnMount takes precedence over JkMount directives, meaning that the JK
will first try to mount and then checks, if there is an exclusion defined by a
JkUnMount. A JkUnMount overrides a JkMount only, if the worker names in the
JkMount and in the JkUnMount are the same.
</p>
<p>
The following example will block all .gif files although there is a JkMount for them:
</p>
<div class="example"><pre>
  # do not send requests ending with .gif to worker1
  JkUnMount /*.gif worker1
  # The .gif files will not be mounted cause JkUnMount takes
  # precedence over JkMount directive
  JkMount /servlet/*.gif worker1
</pre></div>
<p>
Starting with version 1.2.26 of JK you can apply a JkUnMount to any worker,
by using the star character '*' as the worker name in the JkUnMount.
More complex patterns in JkUnMount worker names are not allowed.
</p>
<div class="example"><pre>
  # Mapping the webapps myapp1 and myapp2:
  /myapp1/*=worker1
  /myapp2/*=worker2
  # Exclude the all subdirectories static for all workers:
  !/*/static/*=*
  # Exclude some suffixes for all workers:
  !*.html=*
</pre></div>
<p>
<b>JkAutoAlias</b> directive automatically <b>Alias</b> webapp context directories into
the Apache document space. It enables Apache to serve a static context while Tomcat
serving dynamic context. This directive is used for convenience so that you don't
have to put an apache Alias directive for each application directory inside Tomcat's
webapp directory. For security reasons is is strongly recommended that JkMount
is used to pass all requests to Tomcat by default and JkUnMount is used to
explicitly exclude static content to be served by httpd. It should also be noted
that content served by httpd will bypass any security constraints defined in the
application's web.xml.
</p>
<div class="example"><pre>
  # enter the full path to the tomcat webapps directory
  JkAutoAlias /opt/tomtact/webapps
</pre></div>
<p>The following example shows how to serve a dynamic context by
Tomcat and static using Apache. The webapps directory has to
be accessible by apache.</p>

<div class="example"><pre>
  # enter the full path to the tomcat webapps directory
  JkAutoAlias /opt/tomtact/webapps

  # Mount 'servlets-examples' directory. It's physical location
  # is assumed to be in the /opt/tomtact/webapps/servlets-examples
  # ajp13w is a worker defined in the workers.properties
  JkMount /servlets-examples/* ajp13w

  # Unmount desired static content from servlets-examples webapp.
  # This content will be served by the httpd directly.
  JkUnMount /servlets-examples/*.gif ajp13w
  JkUnMount /servlets-examples/*.jpg ajp13w
</pre></div>
<p>Note that you can have a single JkAutoAlias directive per virtual
host inside your httpd.conf
</p>
<p>
<b>JkWorkerProperty</b> is a new directive available from JK 1.2.7
version. It is a convenient method for setting directives that are
usually set inside <b>workers.propeties</b> file. The parameter for
that directive is raw line from workers.properties file.
</p>
<div class="example"><pre>
  # Just like workers.properties but exact line is prefixed
  # with JkWorkerProperty

  # Minimal jk configuration
  JkWorkerProperty worker.list=ajp13w
  JkWorkerProperty worker.ajp13w.type=ajp13
  JkWorkerProperty worker.ajp13w.host=localhost
  JkWorkerProperty worker.ajp13w.port=8009   
</pre></div>
<p>
<b>JkMountFile</b> is a new directive available from JK 1.2.9
version. It is used for dynamic updates of mount points at runtime.
When the mount file is changed, JK will reload it's content.
</p>
<div class="example"><pre>
  # Load mount points

  JkMountFile conf/uriworkermap.properties
</pre></div>
<p>If the mount point uri starts with an exclamation mark '!'
it defines an exclusion in the same way JkUnMount does.
If the mount point uri starts with minus sign '-'
the mount point will only be disabled. A disabled mount can be reenabled
by deleting the minus sign and waiting for the JkMountFile to reload.
An exclusion can be disabled by prefixing it with a minus sign.
</p>
<div class="example"><pre>
  # Sample uriworkermap.properties file

  /servlets-examples/*=ajp13w
  # Do not map .jpeg files
  !/servlets-examples/*.jpeg=ajp13w
  # Make jsp examples initially disabled  
  -/jsp-examples/*=ajp13w
</pre></div>
<p>At run time you can change the content of this file. For example
removing minus signs will enable the previously disabled uri mappings.
You can add any number of new entries at runtime that reflects the newly deployed
applications. Apache will reload the file and update the mount
points within 60 second interval.
</p>
<p>
There is no way to delete entries by dynamic reloading, but you can disable or
exclude mappings.

<br>

<p>
Alternatively to the mod_jk specific directives, you can also use
SetHandler and environment variables to control, which requests
are being forwarded via which worker. This gives you more flexibility,
but the results might be more difficult to understand. If you mix both
ways of defining the forwards, in general to mod_jk directives will win.
</p>
<p>
<b>SetHandler jakarta-servlet</b> forces requests to be handled by mod_jk.
If you neither specify any workers via JkMount and the related directives,
not via the environment variable described below,
the first worker in the list of all worker will be chosen. You can use SetHandler
for example in Location blocks or with Apache 2.2 also in RewriteRule.
</p>
<p>
In order to control the worker using <b>SetEnvIf</b> or <b>RewriteRule</b>
for more complex rules, you can set the environment variable <b>JK_WORKER_NAME</b>
to the name of your chosen target worker. This enables you to decide on
the chosen worker in a more flexible way, including dependencies on cookie values.
This feature has been added in version 1.2.19 of mod_jk.
</p>
<p>
In order to use another variable than <b>JK_WORKER_NAME</b>, you can set the name
of this variable via the <b>JkWorkerIndicator</b> directive.
</p>
<p>
You can also define exclusions from mod_jk forwards by setting the environment
variable <b>no-jk</b>.
</p>
<div class="example"><pre>
  # Automatically map all encoded urls
  &lt;Location *;jsessionid=&gt;
    SetHandler jakarta-servlet
    SetEnv JK_WORKER_NAME my_worker
  &lt;/Location&gt;

  # Map all subdirs to workers via naming rule
  # and exclude static content.
  &lt;Location /apps/&gt;
    SetHandler jakarta-servlet
    SetEnvIf REQUEST_URI ^/apps/([^/]*)/ JK_WORKER_NAME=$1
    SetEnvIf REQUEST_URI ^/apps/([^/]*)/static no-jk
  &lt;/Location&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>
Finally, starting with version 1.2.27 you can use the environment variable
<b>JK_REPLY_TIMEOUT</b> to dynamically set a reply timeout.
